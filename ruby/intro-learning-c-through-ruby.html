    <p>I’ve been working with a lot of C code lately and it’s amazing!</p>

<p>I started with the modest goal of learning to read the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/GC.html">garbage collector code in CRuby</a> and it spiraled out of control from there. So many projects are built on top of C. It’s one of those programming languages that’s hard to avoid, especially if you’re working on system level software such as <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>, or my favorite tool of all <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. Since that’s the kind of code I like to create, I felt what better time to start learning how to program in C.</p>

</span></p>

<p>So a little background on me before I begin. During my last year and a half of college, I took <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">C++</a> programming courses. They were some of the toughest classes that I’d ever taken, but I learned a lot of the practices of coding that I still try to follow today. Having this knowledge in <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">C++</a> definitely helped me learn how to program in C, since the only noticeable difference between the two is the function-driven vs. object-driven nature of each language. Now I know that all of the language purists will probably read this and complain because there are other differences between the two languages, but I’m just pointing out the most noticeable difference between the two. Since I mostly work in Ruby, I felt comfortable working in Object Oriented code architecture, so I was excited to try something new, and with C code I was that much closer to actually communicating with the machine.</p>

<p>I dove head first into <a href="http://mgm702.com/books">reading books about C programming</a> to learn the best practices of the language. All of this was fascinating and I learned so much about how C has influenced so many programming languages, and how it still remains a powerful language for creating software after all of these years. The biggest pain points in learning C was wrapping my head around pointers again and using them more than ever to move and shape data in my code. A good resource that I found that helped me with many of the subtleties of using pointers was <a href="http://amzn.to/2mReVzT">Understanding and Using C Pointers</a>. This book was incredibly helpful with learning <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-different-types-of-C-pointers">double and dangling pointers</a>, both of which I had struggled with before finding this resource. After finishing <a href="http://amzn.to/2mReVzT">Understanding and Using C Pointers</a> it was time to try to solidify the knowledge that I had recently acquired, but how could I do that?</p>

<p>I decided to turn to the original reason that I started learning C code in the first place, to understand the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/GC.html">MRI garbage collector source code</a>. This time however, I have bigger ambitions than just understanding <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/GC.html">Ruby’s GC code</a>. I now can use my better understanding of C code to help me better grasp the underlying concepts that make up the Ruby programming language. Therefore, in this series of posts, I will describe different methods in Ruby and how they work underneath the surface using C code. Some of it will be simple concepts used to illustrate C’s influence on the Ruby language and some of them will be more complex in order to try and understand the lower level methods that help make Ruby the amazing programming language it is today.</p>
