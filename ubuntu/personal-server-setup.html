    <p>Recently, I’ve been looking for a new solution to hold my private git repositories. I know some people will say to use <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>, because they have free private repos and they’re amazing! And sure it’s true that they have great services that provide git management for you to use as you please, but the problem is that I wanted something that I could not only manage at the system level, but I  also wanted a solution that was independent and customizable. I debated the idea of using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> or <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> to host my personal solution, but the money it would take to create a complete management tool made me think about how I could solve this problem while keeping my costs down. In addition to the price factor, a major point of emphasis for me was to have full control over the server and all of its components. Finally, my last goal with this server was to use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> to create and manage my technology stack, so I wanted to create something on my own. Around this time I was cleaning out part of my house, and what do I happen to find but my old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-15-6-Inch-Processor-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B002PY7OSA">Dell</a> computer. This computer is nothing special but it does have the following specs:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code>
Architecture:          x86_64
CPU(s):                2
Model name:            Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     T6600  @ 2.20GHz
HDD:                   320GB
RAM:                   4096MB
Type:                  DDR2

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Definitely not anything I would brag about or use for my primary development machine, but it still has value to me, and I didn’t want to get rid of it just yet. So I thought to myself, why not try an older approach and configure my own home server that can run on <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> and use the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab CE</a> open source tool to manage my git repos? I could also create other small utility sites that would turn this once dust collecting relic into a fully functional system that my family and I could use for our storage needs. I began thinking about what exactly I wanted on this home server of mine.</p>

<p>I wanted to use a Linux server setup that was stable and could get up and running relatively quickly. I decided to use an Ubuntu Server version 16.04 image. I wanted to use the latest version of the distro, and I wanted to make sure that <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> was the main focus of tool management on the server. However, I also wanted the availability and familiarity of an Ubuntu server, since it’s the distro I’m most comfortable with. I could’ve went with <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> as well, but for now I decided on <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. In the future, as I get better with <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> I will probably move to <a href="https://coreos.com/">CoreOS</a> since it’s size is <a href="https://thenewstack.io/digital-ocean-now-supports-coreos-the-lightweight-linux-distro-for-hosting-docker-containers/">1/4</a> that of a normal Linux distro. Also, <a href="https://www.coreos.com">CoreOS</a> provides tools that assist in managing multiple server container systems at once. This might be useful if my girlfriend ever decides to give up her old Macbook for the good of our server farm <img class="emoji" title=":joy:" alt=":joy:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f602.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle">.</p>

<p>The technology stack that I want to use on this server varies since I plan to use the server as a small project test space, in addition to it’s use as a git repository management tool and media client server. However, the main technology I’ll be focusing on is the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby/Rails</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://puma.io/">Puma Server</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra (small API apps)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After sorting out all of the configurations that I wanted setup in my head, I was finally ready to start developing this server. With any good project though, I needed to first test everything to make sure it was going to work the way I expected it to. This is when I decided to turn to one of my favorite development tools, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a>. I’ll talk more about that though in the next post, but that’s all for right now.</p>
